					for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
					The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
					the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

				<p class="text-xs leading-4 font-semibold opacity-60">    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
					professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
					student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
					did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
					project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
					could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
					experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
					100% recommend! ”
